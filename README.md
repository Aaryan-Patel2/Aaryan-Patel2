# 👋 Hi, I’m Aaryan R. Patel
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and mathematics (wishing to help analyze data for marketing and business purposes when older)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Machine Learning and Data Science using Coursera courses (obviously) and learning how to deal with TensorFlow APIs (super cool :O).
- 💞️ I soon want to collab with a sort of teacher and friend of mine, Rishit-Dagli!
- 📫 How to reach me (I have no serious way of contacting yet, that will be added eventually once I grow, as well as get a Twitter Developer account)
