- 👋 Hi, I’m Aaryan R. Patel! I am 13 years old! I am a "graduated" 7th grader moving onto 8th grade and participating in the Algebra 1/Honors Algebra section of my school
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and mathematics (wishing to help analyze data for marketing and business purposes when older)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do Scientific Computing with Python, as well as learning web development with HTML online (as well as participating in summer school activities based on technology fundamentals).
- 💞️ I soon want to collab with a sort of teacher and friend of mine, Rishit-Dagli!
- 📫 How to reach me (I have no serious way of contacting yet, that will be added eventually once I grow, as well as get a Twitter Developer account)
